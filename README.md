### Setup

It's a pretty basic Next.JS app built with TypeScript.

- `yarn`: Install dependencies
- `yarn dev`: Start server (localhost:3000)
- `yarn test`: Run tests which don't exist yet as of this writing
- `yarn storybook`: Start storybook for isolated component development
- `yarn tsc`: Run type-check on the entire app
- `yarn build`: Creates a production build; this command gets run by Vercel's CI so it's never necessary for a human to do, but can be useful
